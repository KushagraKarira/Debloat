## Todo
1. Improve Android script
2. Support for Batch
3. Create GTK frontend
4. Debloat other OS's ( Windows, Ubuntu... )

Debloating to me is understanding and removing those file/ packages that are not necessary, but to complete the process we need to reconstruct it and for that nothing looks better than open source apps
