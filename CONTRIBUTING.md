## How you can contribute
1. Share - It's simple, you bring in other people that also help make this project better
2. Improve - Since my current phone ( Mi A2 ) has not much of bloatware, i depend on other's for apps they think are bloatware
3. Fix - Sometimes things don't work the way you want them to ( Like the addition i made for Windows ADB ) and need bugs to be fixed
4. Report bugs - Use the scripts, become a hero among your peers for improving their device and share the problems you face
5. Feature request - Is there something you expect from the projet, let us know
6. Document !! - Looks insignificant but of great importance, help other understand the project
